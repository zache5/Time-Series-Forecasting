# Time-Series-Forecasting
In this code, I am creating multiple time-series models to help analyze MercadoLibres e-commerce site in Latin America. The code will be taking in previous data about the search traffic, stock price, and revenue, in order to create Prophet predictions. This code can be used and updated on new data as well to stay up with the trends be prepared for future patterns with users. 

## Technologies
I used Pandas, holovies, prophet, hvlpot, pathlib, datetime, numpy, and mathlib inline in order to run all of the code.

## Installation Guide
import pandas as pd
import holoviews as hv
from prophet import Prophet
import hvplot.pandas
from pathlib import Path
import datetime as dt
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline

## Usage
I produced many charts, demontrating user traffic, stock price, revenue streams, and also the predictive outcomes that Prophet created. I did this using line graphs, but also heatplots in order to visualize when the most activity is taking place. I did this for all differnt time frames, during the day of the week, the week of the year, the month of the year, and so on. If someone wanted to explore this analysis more and slice the data up to other specific times of the year, they would definitely be able to do so with just a slight tweak in the code.

I am the main contributor for this code!
